Private repository for Advanced Rail Management's ARMapp tool. 

Production Demo @ https://tranquil-retreat-43326.herokuapp.com

Current version: 
- Basic full stack shell implemented with MongoDB - Node js Backend - Express Server - React Frontend 
- Basic google map with Polyline implemented. Currently using google-maps-react library for maps... its not ideal. Maybe worth using just vanilla google maps 
- API response format needs work. Data is hardcoded right now and available on https://tranquil-retreat-43326.herokuapp.com/api/coord
- MongoDB might not be the ideal solution. PostGres will be experimented with for the next release.
