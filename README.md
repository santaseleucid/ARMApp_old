Comments: I should be studying for my exam right now. <br>
Private repository for Advanced Rail Management's ARMapp tool. <br>

Production Demo @ https://tranquil-retreat-43326.herokuapp.com

Current version:

Basic full stack shell implemented with MongoDB - Node js Backend - Express Server - React Frontend<br>
Basic google map with Polyline implemented. Currently using google-maps-react library for maps... its not ideal. Maybe worth using just vanilla google maps<br>
API response format needs work. Data is hardcoded right now and available on https://tranquil-retreat-43326.herokuapp.com/api/coord<br>
MongoDB might not be the ideal solution. PostGres will be experimented with for the next release.<br>
